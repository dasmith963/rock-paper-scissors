Rock Paper Scissors

This will be my first attempt at building a functional JavaScript program. The program will play a 5 round game of rock paper scissors, that will keep score, display the results of each round, and declare a winner at the end on the game. The game is only playable from the browser console at the moment, but I plan to revisit this project later
to add a graphical user interface with buttons and text once I learn how to do so.
